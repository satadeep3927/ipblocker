# IPBlocker CLI

## Overview

**IPBlocker CLI** is a lightweight command-line interface tool designed to help system administrators and developers prevent DDoS attacks by efficiently managing IP blocking and monitoring suspicious activities. It offers straightforward commands to block or unblock IPs, view blocked IP lists, and configure settings, all through a terminal-friendly interface.

This CLI tool uses configuration files to define its behavior and ensures ease of use for professionals who prefer working within a terminal environment. It integrates seamlessly with systems, providing enhanced security with minimal setup.
